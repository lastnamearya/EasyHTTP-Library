# EasyHTTP Library
It's a custom AJAX Library that I built to quickly check an Application for HTTP Requests, to work with this library we need a REST API that takes HTTP Requests in 
order to modify some resources. In this library I'm using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - A Fake online REST API for Testing and Prototyping. 

- GET Request
- POST Request
- PUT Request
- DELETE Request
